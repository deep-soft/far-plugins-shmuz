LuaFAR for Editor, building and installation
=============================================

Prerequisites for building
---------------------------
   *  MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)
   *  Lua 5.1 interpreter and compiler: lua.exe, luac.exe
   *  FAR 2.0 PluginSDK include files (plugin.hpp, ...)
   *  Lua 5.1 include files (lua.h, ...), or Lua 5.1 source directory
   *  LuaFAR source directory


Make targets
-------------
LuaFAR for Editor can be built in one of the following ways:
   *  as an embedded version (default) :  make (or "make embed")
   *  as a set of Lua files            :  make noembed

What the target names mean:

   embed    :  Lua scripts and modules are merged into the plugin DLL.
               DLL name: lf4ed.dll.

   noembed  :  The generic LuaFAR plugin DLL is used.
               Lua scripts and modules should be copied into appropriate
               locations on the disk.
               DLL name: luaplug.dll.


Steps required to build
------------------------
1. Change to the directory "build".
2. Edit user's settings in the file "Makefile" (near the top of the file).
3. Run: make [<target>]. See the description of available targets above.


Installation of an embedded version of LuaFAR for Editor
---------------------------------------------------------
Copy directory "lf4ed" into %FARHOME%\Plugins.


Installation of non-embedded version of LuaFAR for Editor
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Copy directory "lf4ed" into %FARHOME%\Plugins.

2. Lua modules directory ("lua_share") should be copied to its final
   location on the disk. It may be renamed, but its subdirectories may not.
   So, copy "lua_share" from this distribution to anywhere in your system
   (e.g. c:\lua_share) and ensure that "c:/lua_share/?.lua"
   is part of package.path.

   Alternatively, if you already have some directory on your package.path
   (e.g. c:\lua\module), then the contents of lua_share directory may be
   copied into it, and the final structure will look like:
      c:\lua\module\strict.lua
      c:\lua\module\far2\dialog.lua
      .....................
      .....................


Run-time dependencies
----------------------
lua5.1.dll and luafarw.dll must be present under some directory listed
within Windows %PATH%.


Important Note
---------------
After the installation, make sure that the plugin directory contains
exactly one file with the .dll extension.
